When Go is compiled, it feels like a dynamic language. Though it has a runtime, unlike JavaScript, it is not an interpreted language and does not rely on any framework. It truly is the best of both worlds. but there is no complete framework in Go. You have to choose more performance, less features, or more features, less perfomance, which is kind of a good trade."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The second point was variables.

For example, Go functions can return zero or multiple values. In Go, you can also declare variables to be returned and then write \"return\" without specifying what to return. A function in JavaScript, on the other hand, must return a value. If you do not return a value, the function will return \"undefined\".

Go is a weirdly sweet language. It's robust, and it's near enough to JavaScript to make it much easier to comprehend for someone who knows JavaScript. No JavaScript with extra steps. I still have a long way to go before I can be half as good in Go as I am in JavaScript, but with constant practice I hope I will get there. Maybe I will update this if necessary.
