# My Personal Blog

Welcome to my personal blog, where I share my thoughts and experiences on a variety of topics. The blog is built using a modern technology stack consisting of Nuxt v2, @nuxt/content v1, @nuxtjs/color-mode, Vuejs v2, and Tailwindcss. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and uses Nuxt's static site generation (SSG) to transform markdown files into HTML pages.

## Usage

To create a new blog post, simply add a new markdown file to the `content` directory. The front matter of the markdown file can be used to specify the post's metadata, such as the title, date, author, etc. Once the markdown file is saved, the blog will automatically generate a new HTML page for the post.
