## Introduction

Two months ago, I found two of my late father's watches, namely a Bvlgari automatic watch and a Chinese quartz pocket watch. These two watches are fake but the automatic ones have sentimental value. Got curious about fixing something, I tried fixing the automatic one. But after opening the back case, it turns out that the escape wheel and the eyepiece of the clock have been damaged for a long time. Being a fake watch, it has no part reference, nor can it be repaired because it is not easy to change small parts and can only be thrown away

Feeling sad and guilty, I tried to find a replacement for the automatic ones. a lot of research is needed to find not only a beautiful automatic watch, but also an easy to repair, durable, affordable price, and have a brand that even watch snob loved. This is my journey to learn about watches and try the hobby of collecting watches. Let get into it.

## Everyday watch

My late father's automatic watch was the kind of everyday diver's watch that could be called an everyday watch. Everyday watch convey style and serenity, but are unobtrusive. Looks cheap but not cheap. Simple and fun.

"Hey szczynk, then what did you buy to replace that broken watch?", someone said.

A month ago, I researched and searched for the most suitable watch, from the price, the specifications such as case width, case height, lug-to-lug width, and lug width, the watch movements such as automatic, quartz, kinetic, or solar, and finally the watch model or how it looks and feels in my hand like too big, or too small, too high, the strap is leather or nato or bracelet, shiny dial, and many more. Usually I am always confused if there are too many choices but not for watches.

I finally chose the [Seiko 5 Sports SRPG33K1 Automatic Green Dial Green Nylon Strap watch](https://www.seikowatches.com/global-en/products/5sports/srpg33k1). It is a kind of everyday field's watch that have military style on it. You can see the specifications and prices for yourself. I chose this watch not only to replace my late father's automatic watch but also as a milestone for me and a reminder that this year I need graduate. Wish me luck.

My photo kinda suck, innit? Well, I'm not a photographer either.

"szczynk, you only have one watch? Sheesh..."

**Being responsible about money, while researching the best specs for money, how you look, feel, rate the watches you've tried in boutiques and also find a watch that's easy to repair, durable and has a brand that even the snobs will love** isn't easy my dudes. You should ask yourself this variable many times before buying another watch. In the end, watches are a material desire, collecting watches is just another hobby, not a daily necessity. If not then I'm afraid your watch collecting hobby has been tainted by the specter of materialism.

## Dress watch

"So, what watch are you going to buy next, szczynk?"

Dress watches are often referred to as the most elegant type of watch. Designed to be simple, elegant, charming, and minimalistic, the dress watch is intended to be worn during formal events.

If my money is eligible to buy a dress watch, I will buy [Seiko Presage SSA387J1 Cocktail Golden Champagne Automatic Light Gold Dial Brown Leather Strap](https://www.seikowatches.com/global-en/products/presage/ssa387j1). Check out that dial and it also has a power reserve complication. I think it suitable with my Batik.

I will edit this blog if I have this dress watch. Stay tuned.
