## Introduction

Maybe you've heard that [ChatGPT can now write graduate theses](https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/tech/20230126080038-37-408317/bisa-nulis-skripsi-lulus-mba-ini-cara-pakai-chatgpt-openai). It's so hot üî• that there was [an overabundance of curiosity that prevented the bot from being used](https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/chatgpt).

Out of curiosity, I tried it on my thesis topic. The results are astounding, and I regret that they came out now. Don't worry, I've graduated from college. Shameless plug: please, I need a job. Well, without further ado, let's go.

## The Chat

- `Szczynk:`

  ```bash
  Good Night ChatGPT, I want you to act as a physics teacher. I will provide some 
  topics related to the study of physics, and it will be your job to explain these 
  concepts in an easy-to-understand manner. This could include providing examples, 
  posing questions or breaking down complex ideas into smaller pieces that are 
  easier to comprehend. My first request is ‚ÄúI need help understanding spin-orbit 
  interaction.‚Äù
  ```

- `ChatGPT:`

  ```bash
  Sure, I had be happy to help you understand spin-orbit interaction. In physics, 
  the spin-orbit interaction is the interaction between the spin of an object (such 
  as an electron) and its motion in an external potential. This interaction results 
  in a coupling between the angular momentum of the object and its orbital motion.

  A simple example of this is the interaction between an electron and the nucleus of 
  an atom. The electron has a spin, which is a type of angular momentum, and it also 
  moves in an orbit around the nucleus. The spin-orbit interaction causes the energy 
  of the electron to depend on both its spin and its orbit.

  This effect is important in many areas of physics, including in the behavior of 
  electrons in solids, in the spectra of atoms and molecules, and in the dynamics of 
  celestial bodies.

  Hope this helps, let me know if you have more questions.

  I need help understanding density functional theory.
  ```

- `ChatGPT:`

  ```bash
  Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a method used in physics and chemistry to 
  calculate the electronic structure of a material or molecule. It is a powerful 
  tool for understanding the properties of materials, such as their electrical 
  conductivity, magnetism, and optical properties, as well as for designing new 
  materials with specific properties.

  The basic idea behind DFT is that the behavior of a system of electrons can be 
  described by the density of electrons in the system, rather than by the behavior 
  of each individual electron. The theory uses the mathematical concept of a 
  "density functional," which is a mathematical function that describes the electron
  density of a system. The behavior of the electrons in the system can be predicted 
  by solving the equations that describe this density functional.

  One of the key advantages of DFT is its computational efficiency, it can handle 
  large systems with many electrons and atoms, making it useful for studying complex 
  materials and molecules. DFT has been widely used to study a variety of materials, 
  such as metals, semiconductors, and biomolecules, and has proven to be a very 
  powerful tool for understanding the behavior of these systems.

  Let me know if you have more questions or need more clarification.

  What will happen if two-dimensional material is given the spin-orbit interaction 
  and an applied electric field?
  ```

- `ChatGPT:`

  ```bash
  When a two-dimensional material is given both a spin-orbit interaction and an 
  applied electric field, it can lead to a number of interesting and potentially 
  useful effects.

  One of the most well-known effects is the emergence of a phenomenon known as the 
  "spin-Hall effect," in which a transverse spin current is generated in response to 
  an applied electric field. This effect is closely related to the spin-orbit 
  interaction, and the strength of the spin-Hall effect can be tuned by adjusting 
  the strength of the spin-orbit interaction. This effect can be used to create 
  efficient spin-based electronic devices, such as spin-transistors and spin-memory 
  devices.

  Another effect that can arise when a 2D material with spin-orbit interaction is 
  subjected to an electric field is the emergence of a phenomenon called "Rashba 
  effect" which is the splitting of the electronic band structure due to the 
  interaction between the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons. This 
  effect can be used to create new types of electronic devices, such as 
  spin-field-effect transistors (spin-FETs) and spintronic devices.

  Additionally, in a 2D material with spin-orbit interaction and an applied electric 
  field, it can lead to the emergence of a phenomenon known as "Dresselhaus effect" 
  which is the splitting of the electronic band structure due to the combination of 
  the crystal symmetry and spin-orbit interaction. This effect can also be used to 
  create new types of electronic devices, such as spin-FETs and spintronic devices.

  It is important to note that these effects are dependent on the specific 2D 
  material and the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and electric field, and 
  the exact behavior will vary depending on these factors.

  what is the impact on the electric and magnetic properties of the two-dimensional 
  material?
  ```

- `ChatGPT:`

  ```bash
  The impact of spin-orbit interaction and an applied electric field on the electric 
  and magnetic properties of a two-dimensional material can be quite significant, 
  depending on the specific material and the strength of the interactions.

  One of the key impacts is the emergence of new types of electronic phases, such as 
  topological insulators and semimetals, which can have novel electrical and 
  magnetic properties. For example, topological insulators have a bulk insulating 
  state and a metallic state on the surface, which can lead to robust spin-polarized 
  surface currents and the emergence of new types of electronic devices.

  The spin-Hall effect and Rashba effect that can arise in a 2D material with 
  spin-orbit interaction and an applied electric field can also have a significant 
  impact on the electric and magnetic properties of the material. The spin-Hall 
  effect can lead to the generation of a transverse spin current in response to an 
  applied electric field, which can be used to create efficient spin-based 
  electronic devices such as spin-transistors and spin-memory devices.

  The Rashba effect can lead to a splitting of the electronic band structure, which 
  can lead to new types of electronic behavior and the creation of new types of 
  electronic devices, such as spin-field-effect transistors (spin-FETs) and 
  spintronic devices.

  In addition to these specific effects, the spin-orbit interaction and applied 
  electric field can also lead to changes in other properties such as the 
  magnetization, conductivity, and optical properties of the material.

  How does it affect the crystal structure of the two-dimensional material? Does it 
  change?
  ```

- `ChatGPT:`

  ```bash
  The spin-orbit interaction and an applied electric field can have an impact on the 
  crystal structure of a two-dimensional material, but the specific effect will 
  depend on the nature of the material and the strength of the interactions.

  In general, the spin-orbit interaction is a relativistic effect that arises from 
  the coupling of the electrons spin and its motion in the crystal lattice. As a 
  result, it can have an impact on the electronic band structure and the properties 
  of the material. However, it does not change the crystal structure of the material 
  itself.

  An applied electric field can also have an impact on the crystal structure of a 
  two-dimensional material, but the exact effect will depend on the specific 
  material and the strength of the field. For example, in some cases, an applied 
  electric field can lead to a change in the crystal symmetry or the formation of 
  domains within the material.

  It is important to note that the specific effect on the crystal structure will 
  depend on the details of the material and the strength of the interactions, and it 
  may vary depending on the specific material and the experimental conditions. 
  Furthermore, the study of the effect of spin-orbit interaction and applied 
  electric field on the crystal structure is an active research area in the field of 
  condensed matter physics, and new findings may emerge in the future.

  ```bash
  Can you tell me what quantities are required to measure the changes in crystal 
  structure, electrical properties, and magnetic properties from the impact of 
  applied electric fields and spin-orbit interactions in these two-dimensional 
  materials using density functional theory and generalized gradient approximation 
  (GGA) exchange-functional correlation?
  ```

- `ChatGPT:`

  ```bash
  To measure the changes in crystal structure, electrical properties, and magnetic 
  properties from the impact of applied electric fields and spin-orbit interactions 
  in two-dimensional materials using density functional theory (DFT) and the 
  generalized gradient approximation (GGA) exchange-correlation functional, several 
  quantities need to be calculated.

  For the crystal structure, the most important quantity is the lattice constant, 
  which is the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattice. This can be 
  calculated by performing a structural optimization calculation using DFT and GGA. 
  Other quantities that can be used to describe the crystal structure, such as the 
  bond angles and the distances between atoms, can also be calculated.

  For the electrical properties, the most important quantities are the band 
  structure and the density of states. The band structure describes the energy 
  levels of the electrons in the material, and it can be calculated by performing a 
  band structure calculation using DFT and GGA. The density of states describes the 
  number of states available for electrons at a given energy, and it can be 
  calculated from the band structure. Other quantities that describe the electrical 
  properties, such as the conductivity and the dielectric constant, can also be 
  calculated.

  For the magnetic properties, the most important quantities are the magnetic moment 
  and the magnetic susceptibility. The magnetic moment describes the total amount of 
  magnetic dipole in the material, and it can be calculated by performing a magnetic 
  calculation using DFT and GGA. The magnetic susceptibility describes the 
  materials response to an external magnetic field and it can be calculated from 
  the magnetic moment. Other quantities that describe the magnetic properties, such 
  as the magnetic anisotropy energy and the Curie temperature, can also be 
  calculated.

  It is important to note that these quantities are calculated using computational 
  methods and the results are not always perfectly accurate, but the DFT and GGA are 
  widely used approximations in the field of materials science and solid state 
  physics, which are able to capture the main features of the systems.
