Hi, I'm **Szczynk** also called as **Bagus**, a final year student of physics degree specialized in material computational physics from State University of Jakarta. Currently working on undergraduate thesis about the effect of external electric field on electrical and magnetic properties of NiBr<sub>2</sub> monolayer based density functional theory (DFT). Wish me pass and publish this year.

I started a blog because I don't like to write but i need to write as a self-reflection note about what I have achieved, currently, and will achieve or experience and also share a little bit of my thoughts, stories, ideas, and rants.

For a start, I'll be sharing my experiences in developing this website, [my resume](https://szczynk.github.io/resume/), [Lookerku](https://test.lookerku.com/), and [Halo10-10](https://www.halo10-io.com/). I developed these websites using Nuxt and other popular open-source libraries.

And if you're interested in the source code of this website or just want to take a peek under the hood, [it's completely open-source](https://github.com/szczynk/blog)!

Stay tuned!
