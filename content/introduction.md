Hi, I'm **Szczynk** also called as **Bagus**, a recent graduate of bachelor of physics degree specialized in material computational physics from the State University of Jakarta who is passionate about backend development and DevOps.

Previously, I worked at Just Call Us as a freelance web developer using a JavaScript stack. I had an internship at PT Solusi Aksesindo Pratama as a backend developer and at the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG), where I conducted research in [the detection of volcanic ash clouds at Mount Agung and Mount Sinabung](https://github.com/szczynk/deteksi_awan_debu_vulkanik_RST_ASH). I was also assigned as [a laboratory assistant](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLURK9u9eO2bms7hNIf-4Eu-SatogRvxj1) for the digital electronics lab.

Finally, I have published my undergraduate thesis about [The Impact of Adjusted Electric Field on The Electrical and Magnetic Properties of NiBr<sub>2</sub> Monolayer with Density Functional Theory](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2377/1/012021). If you interested in DFT, maybe you can take a look. I have been teaching myself about algorithms, data structures, databases, DevOps, and other software engineering concepts in order to broaden my skills.

I'm currently learning scalable web services with Go. Now I'm looking for opportunities and challenges to improve my skills and interests.

I started a blog because I don't like to write but i need to write as a self-reflection note about what I have achieved, currently, and will achieve or experience and also share a little bit of my thoughts, stories, ideas, and rants.

For a start, I'll be sharing my experiences in developing [this website](https://github.com/szczynk/blog), [my resume](https://szczynk.github.io/resume/), [~~Lookerku~~](https://test.lookerku.com/), [Halo10-io Backend](https://www.halo10-io.com/), and [MyCikoding Backend](https://mycikoding.vercel.app). I developed these websites using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Nuxt.js, Vue.js and other popular open-source libraries.

And if you're interested in the source code of this website or just want to take a peek under the hood, [it's completely open-source](https://github.com/szczynk/blog)!

Stay tuned!

TLDR: I use this introduction at github profile and linkedin profile, probably i need to update it all
